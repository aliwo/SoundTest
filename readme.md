What is this?
=============
This is [FridayMario](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7599?pr=idea)
the first plugin in the world to gamify development in IntelliJ IDEs.

See [youtube video](http://youtu.be/tlrl25lwWDs).

WAT?!
=====
Basically, it plays sounds from [Mario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario) video game on various IDE actions.
Yes, it's good fun. Please use responsibly on Friday afternoon.
